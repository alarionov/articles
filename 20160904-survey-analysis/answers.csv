71,367,30,3,2016-08-19 12:46:47 UTC,No problem
71,378,30,3,2016-08-19 12:37:49 UTC,Depends on relationship with this 'SOMEONE'
72,378,30,3,2016-08-19 12:37:52 UTC,A lot of projects are tested manually instead of automation.
70,374,30,3,2016-08-19 14:24:04 UTC,On a rate from 1 to 5 - it would be 3
71,374,30,3,2016-08-19 14:24:44 UTC,Depends on the position. In our company there is a difference in how different specialists are treated
72,374,30,3,2016-08-19 14:25:13 UTC,"No, I think we are following the trends and wouldn't be concerned about this"

64,319,38,3,2016-08-12 07:41:50 UTC,I don't work hard a lot. 
67,319,38,3,2016-08-12 07:47:44 UTC,A person who requires that
66,307,38,3,2016-08-12 08:32:04 UTC,"It would be great to increase salaries once a year according to person affords and feedbacks from teammates and customers. Really, even 50$ increasing per year (of cause if person has a good feedbacks) would be great for me. Also It would be great to have some paid  days off for maternity leave. Even 2 weeks (10 work days) - it would be much better than now (now it's 0). Because woman who just have a baby exhausted and she gives a low performance for you any way in one side, in other side - the regular 20 days paid vacation per year is not enough, because she cannot use its all - she definitely will need it more during the first year of her baby. And, when woman just have a baby, she's definitely need a lot of money, so it's hard for her to take an unpaid days off."
